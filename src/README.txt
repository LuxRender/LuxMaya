What is LuxMaya ?

designed to export a Maya scene to the format used by Lux renderer.

The python plugins are essential to the export process, and these

If you chose to download the .zip archive, unzip it and read the
INSTALL.txt file, otherwise use the installer programs:

Under windows: run the installer .exe program. You will be guided through
the installation process. You will need to have installed Lux first.

Under linux: make the .sh installer script executable, this can be acheived
with the following command:
